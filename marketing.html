    <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
    <p>For us this campaign was about sharing our vision: ‘’in a world where following your dreams has the image of a fairy-tale, we belief people need help to keep searching for their dreams. Only then one can find true happiness’’ we think all dreams are worth following. We put this message forward by creating content on Instagram and TikTok. The objectives in our campaign are Reach objective, Affect objective, Response objective.</p>
    <p>For the Reach objective we expect to reach about 400 people. On Instagram we expect to reach 100 people. 100 people are likely to see our brand, considering the small amount of time to reach customers. We will mostly have to reach consumers from our own environment.  
	On TikTok we expect to reach 300 customers. On TikTok we are less dependent on our own environment, since you are dependent on the algorithm on TikTok, instead of your own followers. So, we think we will reach slightly more people on TikTok. </p>
	  <p> For the Affect objective we have a clear idea of what we want our consumers to feel. On Instagram we want to create content to inspire our consumers. We want the customers to get to know our brand by giving them something to think about, to reflect on their own life. On TikTok we want to entertain our customers, by making short, interesting videos. In this way our consumers engage with our brand while getting curious about our products. </p>
	  <p> For our Response objective we want our content to get our customers to engage with our brand. We accomplish this by asking questions in our campaigns and giving them something to reflect on. This will make our consumers curious and hopefully, it will lead them in buying our products. We want to create both informational and fun content, which will keep the customers engaged and cause them to expectantly spread our content with their friends. </p>
	  
    <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
    <p>While working on this campaign we discovered that it was very difficult to keep up with a posting schedule. Even though we made a structured, clear schedule, it was quite hard to stay on track. We found that social media takes way more time than we anticipated. For a next project we also learned that it is smart to work ahead for your social media campaign, so you always have something ready to post. We also realized that the interviews worked great for us. They gave us a lot of information, which was very useful for our campaign.</p>
	  <p> For our Reach objective we expected to reach about 400 people in total. This totally exceeded our expectations as we reached about 1500 people only with our first two TikTok videos. However, only about 80 people took notice of our Instagram, which is less than we expected. We think the TikTok algorithm was the reason for this difference in reach between Instagram and Tiktok. But we also think the fun content we posted on TikTok attracted people, rather than the more serious content we posted on Instagram.</p>
	  
    <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
    <p>We started a fun brand, with, in our opinion, an important message that should be shared. We shared this message by creating content and posting this on the platforms Instagram and TikTok. If we were to continue this project, we would keep posting on both Instagram and TikTok. We would put a lot of effort in our Tiktok content as we really liked creating this content, and we reach a lot of people on there. We would keep posting positive content and spreading our vision.</p>
    <p>We would also expand our list of products. For example, with Rêvé tote bags. We used a tote bag for a picture for our campaign and we think this would also be a nice product to sell.</p>
    <p>If the project would continue, we would better prepare our social media content. We would finish our content way ahead of posting to get a better structure in our brand.</p>
