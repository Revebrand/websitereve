  </header>

  <main class="container py-4">
    <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
    <p>The goal of this marketing campaign is to share our vision, in order for people to engage with our brand. Therefore we communicated the following vision: ‘’in a world where following your dreams has the image of a fairy-tale, we belief people need help to keep searching for their dreams. Only then one can find true happiness’’. We think all dreams are worth following, and this is the message we want to spread. We want to do this by selling a pen, allowing the consumer to write down their dreams and in this way, make them more likely to come through. We are the first brand to present the product of a pen in this way.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The target audience of our brand Rêvé is gen-Z. Gen-Z has an age range of 10–25-year-olds. We choose this target group because between the ages 10 and 25 many big choices are made. Think about the choice of studies after graduating high school, as well as the choice of job after your studies. After conducting our interviews, we established this target group mostly uses Instagram, WhatsApp and TikTok. They use social media every day, on average they use it two to five hours a day and mostly in the evening and before school. Our target audience loves creating, sharing and discovering fun content on social media, but they also appreciate their offline time.</p>
    <p>Considering this target audience, we want to put our brand message forward on Instagram and TikTok.These two platforms will have the highest reach and engagement, as they are most used within the ages we want to reach, namely on a daily basis, and with most even multiple times on a day. Meaning if we post daily, we can cause daily engagement with our brand. These platforms also allow for different ways of communicating with our audience, namely through posts, stories and reels/TikToks, so we can&nbsp; communicate in images, text and video, giving us many options to bring our vision across. We will make use of hashtags and engage with our audience by posting polls and quizes, as this will increase the engagement with our platforms. It is also possible to track the engagement and interaction with the platforms by the consumersl which we will use to see what is most popular and in this way optimize engagement even more. We will also use offline communication, by spreading our brand through Breda, with stickers and a poster, as our target audience also spends much time in the city with friends. The objectives in our campaign are reach objective, affect objective, and response objective and for this campaign we wil advertise, with as goal to turn consumers to our brand and build a postive brand attitude.</p>
    <p>With our campaign we want to inspire the consumer, as this is what our target audience is looking for, and in this way make use of user oriented positioning. They have to make important decisions, with which they often struggle. Therefore, they are looking for a source of inspiration and with our brand we will provide this, for example with inspiring quotes or questions making the consumer think on social media.&nbsp; When the consumer engages with our brand, we use pathos appeals and a positive brand attitude is buil, making the chance higher that a consumer buys our product when they will get to know it . Consumers have high involvement with our brand and a positive motivation&nbsp; that drives the purchase decision.</p>
    <p>We have created a brand identity of soft colours and shapes that represent calmness and ease, which we will use in this campaign as well.&nbsp; We do not want to come across as imperative, as that will scare the customer away. Just like our goal of this campaign, we want to inspire, not force, as this fits the needs of our target audience best. Compared to the competition, we are unique in this message.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Reach objective we expect to reach a total of approximately 400 people. On Instagram we expect to reach 100 people. 100 people are likely to see our brand, considering the small amount of time to reach customers. We will mostly have to reach consumers from our own environment.  
	On TikTok we expect to reach 300 customers. On TikTok we are less dependent on our own environment, since you are dependent on the algorithm on TikTok, instead of your own followers. So, we think we will reach slightly more people on TikTok. </p>
	  <p> For the Affect objective we have a clear idea of what we want our consumers to feel. On Instagram we want to create content to inspire our consumers. We want the customers to get to know our brand by giving them something to think about, to reflect on their own life. Because our message is to follow your dream, we want to make our customers feel hopefull, less insecure and more confident about their future.&nbsp; On TikTok we want to entertain our customers, by making short, interesting videos. In this way our consumers engage with our brand while getting curious about our products.</p>
	  <p> For our Response objective we want our content to get our customers to engage with our brand and eventually buy our products. We accomplish this by asking questions in our campaigns and giving them something to reflect on. We want to build a positive brand attitude, by inspiring our customers, and in this way persuade them to buy our procucts. We want to create both informational and fun content, which will keep the customers engaged and cause them to expectantly spread our content with their friends, making the engagement with our brand even bigger, and so, will lead to more people buying our products.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
	  
    <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
    <p>While working on this campaign we discovered that it was very difficult to keep up with a posting schedule. Even though we made a structured, clear schedule, it was quite hard to stay on track. We found that social media takes way more time than we anticipated. For a next project we also learned that it is smart to work ahead for your social media campaign, so you always have something ready to post. We also realized that the interviews worked great for us. They gave us a lot of information, which was very useful for our campaign.</p>
    <p>For this campaign we used many different ways of communicating with our target audience, we used for example video, quotes, we asked the opinion of our customers, we made them think about their life by asking them questions, etc. In this way, we could see what attracted our target audience most and what did not. When looking back at the engagement numbers, the videos were the most popular,&nbsp; &nbsp;the videos where we included our target audience within as well as  the videos where we showed our stickers throughout the city or hang a poster on a wall. We can conclude from this that moving images cause the highest interest and most engagement. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p> For our Reach objective we expected to reach about 400 people in total. This totally exceeded our expectations as we reached about 1500 people only with our first two TikTok videos. However, only about 80 people took notice of our Instagram, which is less than we expected. We think the TikTok algorithm was the reason for this difference in reach between Instagram and Tiktok. But we also think the fun content we posted on TikTok attracted people, rather than the more serious content we posted on Instagram.</p>
	  
    <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
    <p><strong>Feia Sevenhuysen</strong></p>
    <p>This project was harder than I thought it would be, but also a lot of fun! We had discussions on how to create content for our social media, what the best time was to post, when to post. These were all things I never thought would be so important. If this project would have continued, I would put more effort in the planning of posting on social media and/or making the post beforehand. The planning we made now was very hard to follow, since we did not make the posts beforehand. We had to make them the day we were posting. This made it hard to do everyday. For the future I will take one or two full days to create all posts (or most of them), to be able to post without problems on the day itself.</p>

	<p>Looking back, I woud have done some things differently. I would done more content with pictures and videos instead of an illustration with a quote, fact or question on it because first of all making the video content was way more fun to do and we got more loving feedback on these post. Thereby, making videos for these posts, created more recognition for our social media. When we asked people to participate in a video, we gave out our insta and got more followers. People were more interested in what else we shared on our social media. </p>
	<p><strong>Laura Borst</strong></p>
    <p> During this project I learned many new things, how to set up a good marketing campaign and&nbsp; actually execute it. This made me realise all the things that are important to consider but also what worked and what did not. Therefore, for a future planning to continue this project, I can take these things into consideration. For example, post more video content instead of images, as these gain more popularity. I would also involve the customer more, like we did when we asked our target audience questions on the street. This spoke more to our target audience and made them feel more involved. In the future I would also make more use of TikTok as we found that this reached the biggest audience, almost 8 times more than on instagram. To reach more people on Instagram I would integrate our hashtag more, allow for our customers to use it as well, for example by letting them share their lost dreams with our hashtag, this will create more engagement on the platfrom with our profile and in this way the algorithm will show our account more and the reach will be wider.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Looking back I would have taken our target audience even more into consideration. As we saw that with the posts where we actually involved our target audience, the engagement was much higher. Also, we adjusted the content to what our target audience would like to see, however we could have done even more research to what our customers particularly like or do not like and taken this into account.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
